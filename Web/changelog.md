#### Features

* **Powerful Infrastructure:** Firebase can power your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more. Focus on creating extraordinary user experiences. We'll take care of the rest.
* **Material Design:** Powered by Angular Material, this project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system.
* **Gulp Integration:** Gulp is a toolkit that will help you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.
* **Angular Framework:** AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.
